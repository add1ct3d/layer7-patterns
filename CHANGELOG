Added dns, gopher.

2003 09 05 
Improved x11, yahoo. Added bearshare.  Changed all patterns to use \xHH
notation instead of non-printable characters.  This release, therefore,
MUST be used only with version >= 0.2.0 of the kernel patch.

2003 08 28
Added irc, ident, x11.  Made a number of patterns more specific by adding
a '^' at the beginning of the line.  Could have also added some $s at the end
of lines, but in anticipation of matching across packets, didn't.
Improved HOWTO.  

2003 08 21
Added counterstrike, live365, pressplay, winmx. Fixed gkrellm.
Fixed several patterns that used uppercase letters, which can't ever
match.  Will fix the kernel patch soon so that this doesn't matter.
Got rid of the #s in files like this one.  They were annoying.  
Just use "*.pat" in your scripts instead of "*".
Added pattern writing HOWTO.

Fixed ftp.  Added gkrellm. Simplified tftp.

2003 08 09
Fixed dhcp.  Added tftp.  Improved aim.
