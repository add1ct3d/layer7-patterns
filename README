These are patterns for use with the Linux layer 7 packet classifier. 
In order to use them, you will need to use the kernel patch and the
modified version of tc available at http://sf.net/projects/l7-filter/
 
The HOWTO at http://l7-filter.sf.net explains how to use these.
The HOWTO in this directory is a guide to writing patterns.

These patterns should be used only with version >= 0.3.0 of the kernel patch.

The "weakpatterns" directory contains patterns that are too general for them
to be really useful.  They are included because (1) they may be good enough
for some purposes and (2) it will make it easier for people to improve them
if there's something to start with.

The "malware" directory contains patterns for viruses and worms.  The
"file_types" directory contains patterns for file types.  Please read
file_types/README if you plan to use any patterns in these directories.

Please report your experience with these patterns to 
l7-filter-developers@lists.sf.net .  You may subscribe to this list at 
http://lists.sourceforge.net/lists/listinfo/l7-filter-developers

Please note that many of these patterns were written by someone (me,
Matthew Strait) who didn't know anything about the protocol in question
until he started doing google searches for it.  So if you think a
pattern is broken and you know better, you probably do!  Let us know.
