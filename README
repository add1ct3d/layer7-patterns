# These are patterns for use with the Linux layer 7 packet classifier. 
# In order to use them, you will need to use the kernel patch and the
# modified version of tc available at http://sf.net/projects/l7-filter/
# 
# There is a HOWTO at http://l7-filter.sf.net which explains how to use these
#
# Please report your experience with these patterns to 
# l7-filter-patterns@lists.sf.net .  You may subscribe to this list at 
# http://lists.sourceforge.net/lists/listinfo/l7-filter-patterns
# 
# General discussion of the layer 7 classifier can be found on
# l7-filter-developers@lists.sf.net

# (This file is all commented so that it can be safely fed to the kernel 
# along with the rest of the files in this directory.)
