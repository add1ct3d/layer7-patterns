These are patterns for use with the Linux layer 7 packet classifier. 
In order to use them, you will need to use the kernel patch and the
modified version of tc available at http://sf.net/projects/l7-filter/
 
The miniHOWTO at http://l7-filter.sf.net explains how to use these.

These patterns should be used only with version >= 0.2.0 of the kernel patch.

Please report your experience with these patterns to 
l7-filter-patterns@lists.sf.net .  You may subscribe to this list at 
http://lists.sourceforge.net/lists/listinfo/l7-filter-patterns
 
General discussion of the layer 7 classifier can be found on
l7-filter-developers@lists.sf.net

The HOWTO in this directory is a guide to writing patterns.
