Here are some patterns that we'd like to have.  Please read HOWTO for
information on writing patterns.
 
Jabber - an open instant messanger protocol (http://www.jabber.org)
Gadu-gadu - a popular Polish instant messenger protocol (so I'm told)
Zephyr - an instant messanger
ICQ - an instant messanger (with some relationship to AIM)
Telnet - old, insecure remote login protocol
LDAP - Lightweight Directory Access Protocol (RFC 2251)
rlogin - remote login
Citrix - Proprietary remote application access protocol

DNS - Domain Name Service
finger - remote user information protocol

Below is the list of protocols supported by the Packeteer, a 
commercial packet shaper.  This list is taken from page 197 of 
http://www.packeteer.com/support/home/DSP/docs/archive/41manuals/refGuide/41.refguide.pdf
We have sorted this list into several categories.  If you can contribute
knowledge to this list, please post to l7-filter-patterns@lists.sf.net
