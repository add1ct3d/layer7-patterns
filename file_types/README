Patterns in this directory are not for network protocols, but rather for
file types.  They are for cases in which you would like to
promote/restrict transfer of one file type regardless of what protocol
it is being transfered over.  (So these could be considered "layer 8"
protocols, if you like.)

Writing patterns for this directory is pretty easy.  Often
/usr/share/magic has everything you need to know. If you'd like
something that isn't here, please ask for it.

Notes:

1) If you want a filter for both a file type and the application layer
protocol that this file type is transported over (i.e. HTML and HTTP),
you should set up your filters so that the file type is tested for in a
child node of the node that tests for the protocol.  In other words, you
should construct trees like this:

(root)
 \_ HTTP
 |   \_ HTML
 |   \_ PDF
 \_ FTP
     \_ TAR
     \_ PS

If you test for file types and protocols at the same level, l7-filter
will usually classify as the protocol because it sees that data first. 
We hope to make this process less clumsy in later releases.

2) A connection may very well contain more than one file transfer. These
will match the first file sent and continue to apply that classification
to all subsequent files of that connection, regardless of their content.

3) Since the file starts later than the application layer protocol
information, you may need to use /proc/net/layer7_numpackets to increase
the number of packets examined. i.e. "echo 12 >
/proc/net/layer7_numpackets"
