This directory hold patterns for viruses, worms and the like.

Please see ../file_types/README

The patterns here now (Code Red, Nimda) are basically for
proof-of-concept.  To usefully control the spread of a new worm through
bandwidth arbitration, it will be necessary for new patterns to be
written quickly in response to the new worm.
