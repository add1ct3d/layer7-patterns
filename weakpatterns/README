Patterns in this directory are weak in the sense that they will very likely 
match things they are not intended to.  Some protocols just don't have much
to latch on to.  It is recommended that you match on port number for these
protocols.  You could use the patterns to verify that traffic on port X really
is what is expected there.  That is, you should do:

If ( on port 79 && looks like finger )
	treat as finger;

But NOT:

If ( looks like finger )
	treat as finger;

Actually, this is fairly good advice for most Internet standard protocols,
but more so for these.
